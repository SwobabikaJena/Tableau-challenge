CITY BIKE DATA ANALYSIS REPORT

Background:
Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.
However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. 
Objective:
City officials have several questions on the program, which this analysis will help to answer based on a set of data reports and uncover two unexpected phenomena.
The questions that we have chosen to answer are:
1.	Who are the most frequent users of city bikes in 2021? (based on Gender, Age Group, Kind of subscribers)

2.	Which are the top 10 frequently used bike stations for starting a journey and ending a journey?

Analysis Result:
The main observations from the analysis are as follows:
	Who are the most frequent users of city bikes in 2021?                                                        (Know the users Dashboard explained)

•	Male riders appear to be the most frequent riders contributing to 66.4% trips in 2021. 
•	Both men and women in the age group of 31-40 years are most actively using the city bike service contributing to approximately 26% and 10% of bike activities in this duration.
•	While a vast majority of the users in every age group prefer to commit to an annual membership (Subscriber type), the trend seems to be skewed when it comes to users in the age group of 51-60, where a little over 50% prefer to get a 24-hour pass or 3-day pass (Customer type)
•	When we consider the average trip durations (in minutes), women in their 20s seem to be riding for the longest durations (approximately 20 minutes) which is quite high when we compare with any other age group of any gender.
 
	Which are the top 10 frequently used bike stations for starting a journey and ending a journey in 2021? (Most Visited Stops dashboard explained)

•	When we consider the number of trips from and to any bike station in this time duration, the top 10 bike stations are almost identical for both starting and ending a trip. This could possibly mean that these stops are close to city center. This can be verified by looking at the “City Official Map” in the analysis section.
